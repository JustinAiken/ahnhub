AhnHub.com
==========

AhnHub is a Github-based site for sharing Adhearsion components with the greater Adhearsion community.

When you create a new Adhearsion component and upload it to Github, notifying AhnHub of your component is as simple as making `http://ahnhub.com` a post-receive hook for the repository. When you commit to the project, Github will POST information about your repository to AhnHub. Thanks to Github, Ahnhub will always be up to date.
